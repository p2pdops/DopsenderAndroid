        Both sender, receiver should turn on Wifi.
        No need of any router just turn on!
        Dopsender uses Wifi-Direct Technology, instead of (hotspot - wifi), both need to turn on wifi only.
        THE WHOLE PROCESS IS OFFLINE.
        Both sender, receiver need to click on "Connect".
        Open GPS and wait a moment while it discovers the other device.
        After other device shows up in list. Click on it.
        Can be done by either sender or receiver
        From bottom menu of file types, select respective one and then you can choose files.
        Just click round send button at bottom-left to send selected files.
        You can repeat this select and sending as many times as you wish. Until you are out of free space
        Once sharing of files is done, click close button at top left corner.
        Click Received Files to show the files you\'ve received.
        Feel free to give suggestions. ðŸ˜Š
